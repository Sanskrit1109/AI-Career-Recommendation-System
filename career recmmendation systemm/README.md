## 📊 How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
The system analyzes your:
- Academic background
- Skills and competencies
- Interests and preferences
- Personality traits
- Work environment preferences
- GPA and academic performance

### 2. Multi-Algorithm Analysis
Three AI algorithms work in parallel:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[User Profile] --> B[NLP Analysis]
    A --> C[Decision Tree]
    A --> D[Collaborative Filtering]
    B --> E[Text Similarity Scoring]
    C --> F[Classification Prediction]
    D --> G[User-based Recommendations]
    E --> H[Combined Scoring]
    F --> H
    G --> H
    H --> I[Final Recommendations]
```

### 3. Intelligent Combination
- **Weighted Scoring**: Each algorithm contributes to the final score
- **Multi-Algorithm Boost**: Careers recommended by multiple algorithms get higher scores
- **Confidence Scoring**: Reliability metrics for each recommendation
